# Gesture Controlled Robot

<!--Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails! -->

Up until my first milestone, I assembled the chassis of the car. I connected the four servo motors to the L298 motor driver and the Arduino Uno. I then uploaded the code from my computer to the Arduino Uno. Finally, I added the battery pack to the car to allow it to be powered independently.
A problem I faced during my first assembly process was that my wheels were always inverse of each other. Two wheels spun in one direction and the other two spun in the other. 
I found the solution when I realized that the assembly of my wires from the servo motors was inverted. Thus, the wheels were always inversed despite the code that I ran.
After properly soldering the wires in the proper order, all four of my wheels spun in sync.
My next step is to add the Bluetooth component to the car and connect it to the glove to enable steering.

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- Retro Game Arcade Console. Play between Tetris and Snake. 
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together: With the motherboard in the middle, I connected six buttons to control different functions. There is a capacitor that stores energy, a speaker that houses the audio unit, and there are three LED displays that provide visuals to the games. 
As I was finishing my soldering, I accidentally burned into the button of my console, rendering the button useless. Thus, using a replacement button, I desoldered the original and replaced it with the functional one.
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
My next step is to work on my main project: Gesture-controlled robot

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

<!--# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
